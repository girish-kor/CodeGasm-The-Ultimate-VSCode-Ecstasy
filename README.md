## 💥 Features

### 🎯 Fluid Editor Settings
Every keystroke should feel like a thrill. My settings are fine-tuned to provide:
- **Automatic Formatting**: Your code will automatically be formatted on save, paste, and typing.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Glide through your code with smooth scrolling—no more awkward, jerky movements.
- **Cursor Delight**: Customizations like smooth cursor blinking and block-style cursor that provide a consistent flow to your coding experience.
- **Code Wrapping**: Word wrapping for lines over 120 characters, so you don’t have to scroll horizontally to see the rest of your code.

### 🔥 Prettier & ESLint Integration
Get the best of both worlds:
- **Prettier** ensures your code is formatted consistently, adhering to best practices. All your files (JS, TS, HTML, CSS, Markdown) will automatically be prettified on save.
- **ESLint** catches those pesky little errors and warnings on the fly, keeping your codebase clean and without surprises.
